# huffman-code
Canonical Huffman code for the information theory course at TU Vienna
Author: Felix Gigler


This short script creates a canonical huffman code for a finite number of symbols whose distributions are known. 

The input is a descending list of probabilities and the script returns a canonical Huffman code.



It is of purely educational purpose and has not been tested rigorously.
